    description:
      "Backstroke of the West is a bootlegged version of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith that contains hilariously poor Chinese-to-English translated subtitles. This bootleg is most well-known for the line 'Do not want,' a mistranslation of Darth Vader's widely parodied 'Noooooo!' I synced the subtitles and the dub to HD video of Revenge of the Sith. I've also added the pre-garbled English subtitles if you wish to compare this masterpiece to the original dialogue from Episode III. Enjoy!",
